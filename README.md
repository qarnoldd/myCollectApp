#MyCollect
A simple Full stack CRUD Application using React as the frontend, coded in Typescript, using a MySQL database connected with Node.js and Express.js. Simple program for me to learn to apply full stack technologies into one project.

## Running the program
First you have to run the backend in a seperate terminal, so navigate to the backend with  
```
cd backend
npm run devStart
```
Then you can get out of this folder and run it concurrently with the frontend service
```
cd ../
npm run dev
```
This will have the backend services available as you use the frontend.
